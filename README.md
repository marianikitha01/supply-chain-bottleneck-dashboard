## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides actionable insights through:

- **Key KPIs**: Average Production Days, Defect Rate, Top Bottleneck Category
- **Trend Analysis**: Delivery Deviation vs. Lead Time over months
- **Stage-Wise Delay**: Avg. Days by Procurement, Production, Assembly, QC
- **Root Cause Breakdown**: Bottlenecks by Category and Product Line
- **Geographic Impact**: Delay Probability across U.S. states

## Key Insights

- **Port Delay** is the top cause of disruption (26K+ cases)
- **Product A** faces the most issues, especially in Production
- **Defect Rate** is alarmingly high at 76.5%
- **QC and Production** are the slowest stages
- **Texas and Illinois** experience the highest shipment delays

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **Tableau**: For visual analytics and dashboard creation  
- **Python (Pandas)**: For initial data cleaning and transformation
